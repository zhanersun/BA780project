# BA780project
Boston Crime Analytics

Our goal for this project is to analyze which areas of Boston have the highest crime rate. We also want to narrow down on specific variables, such as type of crime, district, and what day the crime occurred. With this, we can better predict possible incidents and be able to suggest appropriate reinforcements to make the city of Boston safer.
